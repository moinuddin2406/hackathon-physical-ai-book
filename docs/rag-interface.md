# RAG-Powered Course Assistant

This page hosts the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered chat interface for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. To access the interactive chat, please visit the main page where the chat interface is integrated.

## How It Works

This RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) interface allows you to ask questions about the course materials and get contextually relevant responses based on the content of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. The system:

1. Takes your question as input
2. Searches through the course documents to find relevant information
3. Generates a response based on the retrieved information
4. Provides citations to the source materials

## Features

- **Course Content Search**: Ask questions about any topic covered in the course
- **Multi-language Support**: Toggle between English and Urdu
- **Source Attribution**: Responses include references to the course materials
- **Contextual Understanding**: The system understands context and provides relevant answers
